## Console Managed Switch for Diagnostics

Simplify troubleshooting and management:

- Console port for direct CLI access and diagnostics  
- Managed features including VLANs, QoS, and link aggregation  
- Real-time monitoring for efficient fault isolation and recovery  

Ensure hands-on control and reliable troubleshooting in IT environments.

---

## Ethernet Switch with MAC-Based VLAN

Enable device-level segmentation and security:

- MAC-based VLAN assignment for granular traffic isolation  
- High-speed gigabit/10G connectivity with redundancy support  
- Managed features for secure, identity-based networking  

Deliver dynamic, secure VLAN configuration based on device identity.

---

## Rack-Mount Switch with 48G Capacity

Maximize scalability in rack-based deployments:

- 48 Gigabit ports in a 1U or 2U rack-mountable form factor  
- High-capacity switching with uplink and stacking options  
- VLAN, QoS, and redundancy for enterprise-grade performance  

Support dense, structured connectivity in enterprise and data center racks.

---

## Network Switch with QoS Scheduling and ACLs

Optimize traffic management and security:

- Advanced QoS scheduling for prioritization of critical applications  
- ACLs (Access Control Lists) for traffic filtering and policy enforcement  
- High-performance gigabit/10G switching with redundancy  

Ensure predictable performance and secure access across enterprise networks.
